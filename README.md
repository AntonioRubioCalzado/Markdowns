My R markdowns

R markdowns dealing with lots of concepts from R itself, Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning

There are lots of code from other people. I hope I included all the references. If not, please tell me, that I will update the markdown.

These pages can also be seen at http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/

Note: work in progress.
