```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("hadley/lineprof")
library(lineprof)
```

Profiling code is necessary to find bottlenecks and try to optimize the use of time and memory by removing them.

```{r}
code = '
  read_delim <- function(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",") {
    # Determine number of fields by reading first line
    first <- scan(file, what = character(1), nlines = 1,
      sep = sep, quiet = TRUE)
    p <- length(first)
  
    # Load all fields as character vectors
    all <- scan(file, what = as.list(rep("character", p)),
      sep = sep, skip = if (header) 1 else 0, quiet = TRUE)
  
    # Convert from strings to appropriate types (never to factors)
    all[] <- lapply(all, type.convert, as.is = TRUE)
  
    # Set column names
    if (header) {
      names(all) <- first
    } else {
      names(all) <- paste0("V", seq_along(all))
    }
  
    # Convert list into data frame
    as.data.frame(all)
  }
'

write(code, "source.R")
source("source.R")  # this is necessary for lineprof to work
library(ggplot2)
write.csv(diamonds, "diamonds.csv", row.names = FALSE)
l <- lineprof(read_delim("diamonds.csv"))
l
```

A good way to see the results is to use an interactive explorer using the `shiny` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
# opens a web page that shows your source code annotated with information about how long each line took to run
shine(l)
```

+ The t column visualises how much time in seconds is spent on each line.

+ The a is the memory (in megabytes) allocated by that line of code.

+ The r is the memory (in megabytes) released by that line of code (this may vary, since it depends on the garbage collector).

+ The d is the number of vector duplications that occurred. A vector duplication occurs when R copies a vector as a result of its copy on modify semantics.

To see the values just hover the mouse over the required bar.
